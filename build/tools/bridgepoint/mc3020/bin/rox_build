#
# Description:
# Run this file to build using SQL and marking input alone.  No
# repository is necessary.  Single and multiple domain builds are
# supported.  Input files can be .sql with no graphics, .sql with
# embedded graphics, .xtuml or .bak files.
#
# This utility makes for a long command line, but it serves nicely
# when integrating with automated build environments.
#
# Any marking files that are domain specific (object, domain, event)
# in multi-domain builds must be named with the domain prepended with
# an underscore (e.g. sumo_domain.mark).
# 
# rox_build can also be used in conjunction with third-party version
# control systems (such as CVS, CleareCASE).  rox_build could also be
# used when building models extracted from multiple repositories.  A
# build server could use this utility to perform automatic translation
# of newly checked in materials.  rox_build also serves in test suite
# automation.
